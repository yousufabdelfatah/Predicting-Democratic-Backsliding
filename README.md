Much has been made recently of the fact that the global trend towards democracy seems to be reversing and that many countries are experiencing what is known as democratic backsliding. Democratic backsliding, defined as the “state-led debilitation or elimination of the political institutions sustaining an existing democracy,” is a catch-all term to describe the various processes by which states move towards more authoritarian forms of governance. In this project, I’ve attempted to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict democratic backsliding.
